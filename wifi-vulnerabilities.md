The fake APs attacks exploit one of the major weaknesses of current Wi-Fi: the lack of authentication of the APs. As wired ethernet hosts, 802.11 nodes are identified with a MAC and there is an implicit trust in the senderâ€™s identity. The data traffic can be encrypted to provide confidentiality, but management frames must be heard and understood by all clients and therefore must be transmitted unencrypted [2].
