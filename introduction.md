Wi-Fi is nowadays the preferred medium for users to access the internet or any other networked service. However as it is a shared medium, the Wi-Fi is secured with security controls ensuring a high degree of confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, most online services require secure protocols such as HTTPS, thus confidentiality and integrity get assured. On top of this, VPNs are often used, so there is an additional layer of security.
The main weakness is the lack of authentication of the AP towards the station, so some attacks aim at introducing a fake AP to act as a MITM. A MITM attack may be rather surreptitious and aim at collecting cookies [1], changing data in transit, injecting malware, or simply collecting credentials with phishing via a captive portal. One such way is to forge a Wi-Fi AP and lure the users into connecting to it. This is the concept of the attacks with rogue or evil twin APs.
